# ChatGPT Tips and Tricks

Welcome üëã!

This repo is a collection of tips, tricks, scripts, and tools that we use at EtnaLabs to optimize the development flow
with ChatGPT.

Whether you're new to ChatGPT or a seasoned pro-user, this repository aims to provide valuable resources to enhance your
experience.

## Sai
You can't remember how to build and run a docker image or some other commands, you can ask sai. Here are a few examples:

```bash
 ‚ùØ sai "how do you build and run a docker image?"
docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_dockerfile>

docker run <image_name>
```

```bash
 ‚ùØ sai "how do you find stash only staged changes in git?"
git stash save --keep-index
```

```bash
 ‚ùØ sai "how do you get the list of files ordered by name?"
ls -l | sort -k 9
```


## Makefile Commands
Copy the Makefile into your directory and use the following commands.

### gpt-update-filepaths
This command updates Python and NodeJS files in your project `.py|.js|.ts|.tsx`, 
adding at the top a comment that indicate the filepath. This is very helpful for your copy/paste in ChatGPT. Run it with the following make command:
```bash
make gpt-update-filepath
```

### gpt-context
This command provide ChatGPT with the context of your NodeJS and Python projects. It provides information
about the project tree and the packages, which you can copy to the clipboard and use in your ChatGPT conversations.  Run it with the following make command:
  ```bash

  ```
